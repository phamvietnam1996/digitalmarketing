											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<p>As a Digital Marketer, I also pay attention to some parts of IT knowledge. They include data analysis, big data, website coding, mobile app, cyber security. I wish that I could be professional in all these fields, which will be really useful for my job. But I now have to focus more on Digital Marketing, which is my main career path.
										<br><br>
                                        I choose to learn in RMIT Melbourne because I already learned in RMIT Vietnam, and this is the good way for me to experience in one of the best cities in the world. And the reason why I choose to learn in RMIT Vietnam is that RMIT Vietnam is the best university in my home country. However, Vietnam campus is smaller than Melbourne city campus here. It just has about 4 buildings. So that why I choose to exchange to RMIT Melbourne.
										<br><br>
                                        What I expect to learn in this "Introduction to Information Technology" course is foundational knowledge of IT areas. I would like to understand the mindset of a person who learns IT, as my bachelor major is Marketing and then I became a Digital Marketer, which are different areas with IT. Marketing focuses on theories and the ways to connect between a brand with customers. Digital Marketing focuses more on reaching customers on the online platforms, and a digital marketer usually works with tools and data.

										<h3></h3>
										<p>Next, I would like to mention about my ideal job. As I will come back to my home country in August, so my ideal job now is a Digital Marketing Manager or Marketing Executive with the salary between, which is actually high in Vietnam, where the cost of living is low and it cost you just 2 dollars for a meal. Here is my job description as a Digital Marketing Manager. Here is my job description as a Digital Marketing Executive. Here is my resume.</p>
									
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3></h3>
										<p>I already have a plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. Firstly, I try to ask for an internship job in Australia. This internship will improve my resume in my home country, as Vietnam companies highly appreciate those who already worked in a foreign country. It is quite difficult for a Vietnamese international student to get an internship office job in Australia in a very shoft period, however, I already did that. Secondly, I will learn everything I could about Marketing, and contribute everything I have in Digital Marketing to S&W company. I also do freelance job as a Digital Marketer to pay for my living here. Actually, my salary in Vietnam is already enough for me to live here for half of a year. That is the three things that I do now to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience for my future position.</p>

										<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
										<p>- <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/3bf415cbf7e4b">Result</a> of my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test.
                                        <br>
                                        - <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-results.shtml?event=results&A=5&V=8&T=7&N=Pham%20Viet%20Nam">Result</a> of my learning style test. 
                                        <br>    
                                        - <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/11697/test-results/7335325">Result</a> of my Big Five Personality test
                                        <br><br>
                                        <span style="width:30%" class="logo"><img src="images/pic07.png" width="80%" alt="" /></span>
                                        <br>
                                        Big Five Personality result
                                        <br><br>
                                        Each of three tests above means different things about my personality. My MBTI test results that my personality is ESFJ-A. ESFJ is people who enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The Learning test describes me as a visual learner. A visual learner learns by reading or seeing pictures. I understand and remember things by sight. I can picture what I am learning in my head, and I learn best by using methods that are primarily visual.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The result of Big Five Personality test reveals that I have positive emotions, have no fear. I am an extrovert and have high conscientiousness.
                                        <br><br>
                                        These results reveal my behaviour in a team, that I am an extrovert, easy to collaborate, and have positive emotions.
                                        <br><br>    
                                        In fact, I am often a leader at work, and I have cooperative leadership style. When forming a team, I should definitely use my leadership strength, which is the ability of encouraging cooperation. This style is more appropriate for a team of new or unskillful members. On the other hand, if I form a team of experienced members, I should try to leave them more space, just give them direction, and let them find their own ways to finish their tasks.
                                        <br><br>

									<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
                                    <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
                                    <p>As I will work in SW Consulting Company, my project relates to the data analytics processed to develop the company's digital marketing strategy.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Data analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data for purposes of understanding. My project for data analytics will focus on online website analytics and data for online advertising.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Web analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of web data for purposes of understanding and optimising web usage.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Data for online advertising focuses on customer demographics, interests, behaviors, reporting and managing the ads.
                                    <br>
                                    <h3><b>Motivation</b></h3>
                                    The project is both interesting and useful. It is interesting because after finishing the project or reading its report, you will gain a lot of knowledge, interesting data and even know how to do it. It is useful for me because I can apply the data in this project for my job in reality.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a digital marketer, I will have to run facebook ads, google ads, other online ads, optimise the company's website and optimise it on Google search engine (SEO).
                                    <br><br>
                                    So the project of data analytics including website analytics and online advertising is really useful for me.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3><b>Tools & Technologies</b></h3>
                                    I will introduce the tools and technologies I use first, because we absolutely use these tools in this project, and I will show how to use it later in the details. There are many tools for data analytics, but here I just go into the details for the most important tools.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The first tool is Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google Analytics became the most widely used web analytics service on the web.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The second tool is Ahrefs. Ahrefs is a well-known paid toolset for website and SEO analysis. If you are looking for a comprehensive SEO website analysis, then Ahrefs should be your preferred choice as it provides key SEO details. It can also analyse website of your competitors.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The other digital marketing channel is Facebook advertising. Facebook ads are becoming known as one of the cheapest way to advertise online and reach many potential customers.
                                    </p>
								<p class="content">
                                <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
                                This part will give the detailed description of the tools' features which will help us to process the data analytics.
                                <br><br>
                                Google Analytics offers an easy and free way to track and analyze visitors on your website. You just have to follow the instructions to add the tracking code to your website or mobile app so you can collect data in your Analytics property. Here is the 10 benefits of using Google Analytics:
<br>&bull; Target your online visitors.
<br>&bull; Evaluate traffic flow through your website.
<br>&bull; Know what users are searching on your website.
<br>&bull; Targeted Campaigns.
<br>&bull; Allows for Campaign Tracking.
<br>&bull; Customized Data/Reports.
<br>&bull; Goal Setting & Monitoring.
<br>&bull; Automated Emails.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, this is the website data of a company I worked in my home country Vietnam (<a href="https://www.vietnamworks.com/">VietnamWorks</a> - biggest recruitment website in Vietnam). We can see the traffics, reader behaviors, and many other types of report.
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="width:30%" class="logo"><img src="images/pic08.png" width="100%" alt=""></span>
                        <span style="width:30%" class="logo"><img src="images/pic09.png" width="100%" alt=""></span>
                                <br><br>
                                We can use Ahrefs tool to analyse the competitors' website or any website by just searching the domain name.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, I analyse my current website's company SW Consulting.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="width:30%" class="logo"><img src="images/pic10.png" width="100%" alt=""></span>
                                <br><br>
                                We can know the website's strength, domain rating, number of backlinks and referring domains, the organic keywords on top of the Google search engine, estimated organic traffic. And there are many full of details when we click into each things.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, when we click in Backlink, it shows you the the detail of 9,000 backlinks, including, the backlink strength, which website it comes from, the date Google index this backlink, the anchor text.
                                <br><br>
                                If we click in Organic keywords, we can know which keywords people often search and which ones relate to our website's topic.
                                <br><br>
                                Facebook Ads is easy to use. We just have to know how to create a campaign, write an attractive content, target the right audience, right customer demographics and interests, manage the bidding cost. And that's so.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="width:30%" class="logo"><img src="images/pic11.png" width="100%" alt=""></span>
                                <br><br>
                                After we run it for a short time, we can see the detailed report with CPM, CPC, and just adjust these ads. We increase the budget for the good ads, and decrease the budget for the bad ones.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, when one of my ads has too high Cost per 1,000 impression (CPM), I understand that my target of this ad is not really good, and I reduce the budget for it. If one of my ads has too high cost per click (CPC), I can understand that its content is not attractive to customers, so I update or change to other posts.
